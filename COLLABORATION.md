# 🤝 DevCollab Collaboration & Workflow Guide  

Welcome to the **DevCollab Collaboration Playbook**.  
This document defines **how teams work together**, the **tools we use**, and the **standards** to ensure high-quality, consistent, and efficient delivery of DevCollab.  

---

## 🌍 Core Collaboration Principles  

1. **Transparency** → Open communication, documented decisions, visible progress.  
2. **Async-First** → Default to async tools (issues, PRs, docs) to reduce dependency on real-time meetings.  
3. **Single Source of Truth** → GitHub (code), Supabase (DB), Notion/Docs (knowledge base).  
4. **Design-Driven Development** → UI/UX aligned before implementation.  
5. **AI-Augmented Workflows** → Codestral + OpenAI copilots used responsibly for code, docs, and reviews.

## 🛠️ Collaboration Tools & Integrations  

| Category        | Tool/Service | Usage |
|-----------------|--------------|-------|
| **Source Control** | GitHub | Code hosting, issues, PRs, projects |
| **CI/CD**       | GitHub Actions | Tests, lint, builds, deployments |
| **Hosting**     | Vercel | Frontend apps (Next.js) |
|                 | Supabase | Database, Auth, Edge Functions |
| **Design & UI** | Figma, Storybook, shadcn/ui | Design systems, prototypes, component previews |
| **Communication** | Slack/Discord | Daily sync, dev chat, announcements |
|                 | GitHub Discussions | Feature debates, RFCs |
| **Docs & PM**   | Notion + GitHub Wiki | Knowledge base, specs |
| **Monitoring**  | Sentry, Grafana, Prometheus | Error tracking, logs, infra observability |
| **AI Support**  | Codestral AI, OpenAI GPT-4 | Copilot for code/docs, test generation |
| **Events**      | Zoom/DevCollab Events | Live workshops, demos, onboarding |

## 📦 Repository Collaboration Workflow  

### Branching Strategy (GitHub Flow + Teams)  
- **`main`** → Production-ready branch (deployed on Vercel).  
- **`dev`** → Staging branch (integration environment).  
- **Feature branches** → `team/feature-name`  
  - Example: `builders/ide-live-cursors`, `pixel/design-system-update`  
- **Hotfixes** → `hotfix/critical-bug`  

### Pull Request Process  
1. PR opened → auto-checks triggered (lint, tests, build).  
2. Reviewers assigned (at least **1 from another team**).  
3. Design/UI PRs must be validated in **Storybook Preview**.  
4. Merge strategy → **Squash & merge** (clean history).  
5. PR template enforced (context, screenshots, testing steps).  

---

## 🎨 Design & UI Collaboration (Pixel Foundry + All Teams)  

- **Design System** → Centralized in `/packages/ui`  
- **Storybook** → Every UI component must have stories for states (loading, error, success).  
- **Accessibility** → WCAG 2.1 AA compliance required.  
- **Theme Consistency** → Tailwind + shadcn tokens synced from Figma.  
- **UI Review Process**:  
  - Step 1: Prototype in Figma  
  - Step 2: Review with Pixel Foundry & Growth Squad  
  - Step 3: Build component in Storybook  
  - Step 4: Integrate into feature branch  

---

## 🖥️ Developer Collaboration Guidelines  

### Code Standards  
- Language: **TypeScript (strict mode enabled)**  
- Frameworks: Next.js (frontend), Fastify/Node.js (backend)  
- Linting: ESLint + Prettier enforced via CI  
- Testing: Vitest/Jest + Playwright for E2E  
- Commit Style: Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`)  

### Pair Programming / Live Coding  
- Use DevCollab’s built-in IDE/video for synchronous work.  
- Shared coding sessions must be **recorded** for async reference.  
- Code comments → Explain *why* not just *what*.  

---

## 📊 Collaboration Across Teams

## 🔄 Weekly Collaboration Cadence  

- **Monday** → All-hands sync (15 mins, async notes shared).  
- **Mid-week** → Team-specific standups (Slack/Discord).  
- **Friday** → Demo day (PR demos, event previews).  
- **Monthly** → Cross-team retrospective + roadmap alignment.  

---

## ⚠️ Conflict Resolution  

- **Step 1**: Raise issue in GitHub Discussion.  
- **Step 2**: Async resolution attempt.  
- **Step 3**: Escalate to Strategy Circle for arbitration.  
- **Step 4**: Document final decision in `/docs/decisions`.

## 📐 Collaboration UI/UX for DevCollab  

The platform itself **mirrors our collaboration process**:  
- **Multi-cursor IDE** → Live code sessions (Builders Hub).  
- **Session replay** → Async review of coding events.  
- **Design review mode** → UI/UX feedback within Storybook previews.  
- **Event hosting** → Growth Squad runs live onboarding/demos.  
- **AI copilots** → Data Guild supports PR reviews, auto-docs, learning.  

---

## ✅ Collaboration Best Practices  

- Document decisions in `/docs/decisions`.  
- Always link Figma file / issue / PR in commits.  
- Keep async-first: use issues before meetings.  
- Prefer smaller PRs (easier to review, merge faster).  
- Every new feature → must include docs + tests + Storybook updates.  

---

## 📞 Support Channels  

- **GitHub Discussions** → Feature requests, RFCs  
- **Slack/Discord** → Day-to-day sync, fast questions  
- **Docs Hub** → `/docs` folder + Notion knowledge base  
- **Emergency** → PagerDuty (Ops & Flow on call)
