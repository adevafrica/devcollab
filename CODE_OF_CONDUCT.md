# 📜 DevCollab Code of Conduct  

This Code of Conduct outlines the **standards, expectations, and responsibilities** for all contributors, teams, and community members engaging in the **DevCollab project**.  

Our goal: to foster a **collaborative, professional, and inclusive environment** where developers, designers, data scientists, educators, and communities can work together effectively.

## 🌍 Core Principles  

1. **Respect & Inclusivity** — Every contributor deserves to be treated with dignity.  
2. **Collaboration First** — We succeed as a team, not as individuals.  
3. **Transparency** — Decisions are documented, processes are visible, and discussions are open.  
4. **Professionalism** — Communication, coding, design, and events reflect the highest standards.  
5. **AI Responsibility** — AI assistants (Codestral, OpenAI, etc.) are used ethically, with human oversight.

- Provide constructive feedback in PRs, design reviews, and event planning.  
- Attribute properly when reusing **code, UI assets, or AI outputs**.  
- Follow accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA) when designing or coding.

## ⚖️ Enforcement  

1. **First Step** → Private reminder/warning from team leads.  
2. **Second Step** → Formal written notice documented in repo.  
3. **Third Step** → Escalation to **Strategy Circle** for arbitration.  
4. **Final Step** → Removal from project/org if violations persist.  

Enforcement applies to **all contributors, maintainers, and community members**, regardless of role or seniority.
